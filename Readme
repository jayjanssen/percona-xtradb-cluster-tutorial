This Vagrant setup can be used to test Percona XtraDB Cluster (Percona Server with Galera)

This is used with Centos 6 x86_64.

If you don't have a Centos 6 base box, you can download mine at http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11697684/centos6.box.bz2
This box includes puppet, firewall is disabled and has a nice motd ;)

How to use ?

to boot them all at once:

 vagrant up

to boot them one by one:

vagrant up node1
vagrant up node2
vagrant up node3
vagrant up client

And this is all, you have now 3 servers running Percona XtraDB Cluster and one client in the same network !


These recipes also install HAProxy on node1.  One for writes (single cluster node) and one for reads (rr of all cluster nodes).

See cluster status: http://192.168.70.2:9999/

Writes: 192.168.70.2:4306
Reads: 192.168.70.2:5306


Note: SElinux is disabled, there is a selinux policy file included that allows the server to start but the other nodes aren't yet able to sync, I need to investigate...
