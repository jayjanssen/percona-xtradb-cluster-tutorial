State Snapshot Transfer (SST) and the Donor node
======================

Finding the Donor node
----------------------

When an state transfer is required, an existing cluster node is selected to be the *Donor*.  A backup is taken of this node to copy to the node requiring the state transfer.  We already saw this when bringing up our nodes.  However, let's see the behavior of the donor node.  

On node3, baseline the node and restart mysql so an SST happens::

	[root@node3 ~]# baseline.sh 
	Shutting down MySQL (Percona Server).... SUCCESS! 
	...
	[root@node3 ~]# cp /etc/my.cnf.cheater /etc/my.cnf
	[root@node3 ~]# service mysql start
	Starting MySQL (Percona Server).................................................. SUCCESS!


While the server was restarting, check ``myq_status`` to see who is the donor::

	Wsrep    Cluster         Node                 Flow        Replicated      Received
	    time stat conf size   rdy  cmt  ctd dist  paus sent   que  ops size   que  ops size
	18:22:13 Prim   17    3    ON Dono   ON    0     0    0     0    0    0     0  1.0 58.0
	
Notice the ``Node cmt`` is ``Dono`` or *Donor*.  

Forcing a Donor
---------------

Let's force one of our nodes to be the donor always so we can perform some tests on it.  Add the following line to the my.cnf of node3::

	[mysqld]
	...
	wsrep_sst_donor=node2

In this case node2 will always be selected to be the donor (assuming it is alive).


Reads and writes on the Donor with xtrabackup SST
-------------------------------------------------

node2 is our dedicated Donor node, so let's start some regular writes there so we can see how it behaves during Donation.  On node2, setup and start `pt-heartbeat <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/pt-heartbeat.html>`_ so a row gets updated every second from there.  Due to a limitation of pt-heartbeat, we must create a legacy version of the heartbeat table that will work with PXC::

	node2 mysql> create schema percona;
	use percona;
	CREATE TABLE heartbeat (
		id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
		ts datetime NOT NULL
	);
	
Now, start pt-heartbeat on node2::

	[root@node2 ~]# pt-heartbeat --update --database percona
	
One node1, let's monitor the heartbeat::

	[root@node1 ~]# pt-heartbeat --monitor --database percona
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]

This output will show us if there are any delays in the heartbeat compared with the current time.  

Now, re-baseline node3 and restart an SST.  Watch the heartbeat monitor on node1 and myq_status on node2 carefully.  What do you observe?  Any idea why?

**Bonus points**: Modify /usr/bin/wsrep_sst_xtrabackup on node2 add ``--no-lock`` to ``INNOBACKUPEX_ARGS``::

	INNOBACKUPEX_ARGS="--no-lock"

How does that change the behavior?  When is that safe to run?


Reads and writes on the Donor with rsync SST
--------------------------------------------

Let's see how rsync SST is different from Xtrabackup.  Back on node3, change the SST method::

	wsrep_sst_method=rsync

and reset and restart mysql here.  What differences do you note compared with xtrabackup SST?

If you have time, feel free to try other SST methods.  All the possible options are easy to find::

	[root@node2 ~]# rpm -ql Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-server | grep wsrep_sst

- Which method is the fastest?
- Will that hold true as the database grows?
- Which method causes the least interference with cluster operations?
