TL;DR
-------

It's a **very** good idea to do these steps *before* the tutorial session because conference WiFi tends to be unreliable at best.  At a minimum, at least do up through the step to download the centos6 box, which is several hundred MB.

#. Download and install Virtualbox from `here <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_. (Current version: 4.1.18)
#. Download and install Vagrant from `here <http://vagrantup.com>`_.  Current version: 1.0.3
#. Keep your virtual box guest additions updated automatically: ``host> vagrant gem install vagrant-vbguest``
#. Download centos6 vagrant box: (310MB) (optional, `vagrant up` will do this automatically): ``vagrant box add centos6 https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7225008/Vagrant/CentOS-6.3-x86_64-minimal.box``
#. Get a copy of this git repository: ``host> git clone https://github.com/jayjanssen/pxc-tutorial``
#. Run ``vagrant up``::

	cd pxc-tutorial
	vagrant up
	
That should do it!

What does this actually do?
---------------------------

The basic flow of what's happening above is:

#. Downloading virtualbox -- this can run virtual machines on your laptop and supports Linux, Mac, and Windows (and is free).
#. Installing the Vagrant tool -- This tool knows how to setup and manipulate a set of VirtualBox VMs using something called a *VagrantFile*, which is somewhat analogous to a *MakeFile*.
#. Virtualbox VMs use tools installed on the GuestOS to do things like share folders with the host machine (i.e., your laptop).  This step allows Vagrant to keep those tools up to date with whatever version of VirtualBox you have.
#. Vagrant uses *boxes* for baseline OS installs to build on.  This step downloads a CentOS 6.3 minimal image and names it as the box `centos6`.  *VagrantFiles* can refer to this box when they want to build a VM.
#. You will need a local copy of all the code and configuration in this git repository on your local machine.  If you don't have/like git, you can download it a full tarball/zip file from github.
#. `vagrant up` sets up all the cluster nodes and PXC according to the rules found in the VagrantFile (and subsequent Puppet configuration).  If all goes correctly, you should have a working 3 node PXC cluster.


Things you can do with vagrant
------------------------------------

`vagrant up`
	Creates any and all nodes called for by the Vagrantfile in the current working directory and provisions them (i.e., configures them by invoking Puppet on each).

`vagrant provision`
	re-runs puppet on all your vms
	
`vagrant ssh <node>`
	ssh into <node> as the user 'vagrant'.  Use 'sudo -i' to become root.  The nodes are named `node1`, `node2`, and`node3`.
	
`vagrant suspend`
	*Suspends* the virtual machines in this working directory.  This stops the VM processes and stops them from taking up memory on your laptop.
	
`vagrant resume`
	*Resumes* all suspended virtual machines so you can continue working.

`vagrant destroy -f`
	Forcibly destroy all the VMs Vagrant has setup in this working directory (doesn't affect other Vagrant projects).  Using this and another `vagrant up` you can reset back to a baseline config, although it's usually not necessary to go this far.


To log into a node
------------------
::

	host> vagrant ssh node2
	Last login: Thu Aug  9 18:34:53 2012 from 10.0.2.2
	[vagrant@node2 ~]$ sudo -i
	[root@node2 ~]#

Notes
------

- Each node is running a primary IP on the 192.168.70.0/24 subnet.  For the purposes of these exercises, this is the network for all client connections as well as cluster replication and any other tasks.

- Virtualbox *might* crash your laptop every once in a while.  If you don't like it, ask Oracle for your money back.

- Running the command ``baseline.sh`` on any node will do the following:

  - Stop mysqld
  - Remove /etc/my.cnf
  - Wipe out the existing /var/lib/mysql and create a clean datadir.

- If a node gets into a weird state, try doing the ``baseline.sh`` trick on it and then::

	host> vagrant provision <node>

- You can remove the cluster state on a node without affecting the data on that node by removing::
	/var/lib/mysql/grastate.dat

- Sometimes init.d loses track of a mysqld instance.  If you can't shutdown mysqld with ``service mysql stop``, try ``mysqladmin shutdown``.  If that doesn't work, try ``killall mysqld_safe; killall mysqld``


Terms and conventions
---------------------

PXC
	Percona XtraDB Cluster. http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/index.html

Galera
	The technology on which PXC is based.  PXC is basically Galera + Percona Server.  See http://codership.com for more info.

wsrep
	Short for 'Work-Set Replicator'.  You'll see this referred to in mysql settings (SHOW VARIABLES and SHOW STATUS) to for Galera items.

VirtualBox
	Oracle's Free Virtual Machine tool (analogous to VMware).  http://www.virtualbox.org
	
Vagrant
	Tool to manage and configure VMs according to a standard recipe.  http://vagrantup.com

`host>` 
	means your laptop from the root directory of the git repository
	
screen#
	Often the walkthrough instructions assume you have multiple windows or screens open so you can watch multiple things at once.  This can be a physically separate terminal window, or a unix `screen` window if you are comfortable with it.  Note that `screen` is preinstalled on the nodes for your convenience.


Running pt-heartbeat
---------------------

I use pt-heartbeat in my PXC testing to show when there are replication hiccups and delays.  Due to a limitation of pt-heartbeat, we must create a legacy version of the heartbeat table that will work with PXC::

	node2 mysql> create schema percona;
	Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

	node2 mysql> CREATE TABLE percona.heartbeat (
	    id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	    ts datetime NOT NULL
	    );
	Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
	
Now, start pt-heartbeat on node2::

	[root@node2 ~]# pt-heartbeat --update --database percona
	
One node1, let's monitor the heartbeat::

	[root@node1 ~]# pt-heartbeat --monitor --database percona
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]
	   0s [  0.00s,  0.00s,  0.00s ]

This output will show us if there are any delays in the heartbeat compared with the current time.
